# ⌨️ Greg’s Karabiner.ts Mods

This TS package contains [Karabiner.ts][karabiner.ts] recipes for QMK-like
layers (hold-tap, mod-tap) with powerful features
([permissive hold][permissive-hold], chordal hold, hold on key press).
This package builds upon these layers to provide the first turn-key solution
for home row mods that doesn’t suck.
